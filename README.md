3D Printed Case for Arduino Uno Leonardo
----------------------------------------


This repository contains all source codes for "3D Printed Case for Arduino Uno Leonardo"

These codes are written with OpenSCAD.

__Manual__

This project is not finished, so it maybe hard to modify it.  
However, if you want to try, here is how to do it:

There is a file with _param in the name in each version (it is same for both but it need to be in same folder with other files), you should start editing from this file. This not produce any output, there are parameters shared by each segment.

Most of them like width, wide, height should work fine, when you change something other things should match.

Some of them will not work like this.

Some dimensions are still hardcoded (pcb legs positions) and need to be amended in main files.
